Technologies: HTML and JavaScript


Installation
------------

1. Running this application requires a web server such as WampServer on Windows (http://www.wampserver.com/en/). Download, install and launch Wamp before copying and pasting the folder "wingviewer" to the directory C:\wamp\www\ or where you have installed it.

2. Open your web browser and enter the address localhost/wingviewer/. That's it!

Note that this is only required if you intend to run the application locally on your machine or if you want to extend it. An example of this application is available on the WingJ project webpage (http://lis.epfl.ch/wingj).
